**Software Developer, Biomedical Zone Co-Development Lab (Oct. 2018- Mar. 2019)**

I pursued an extracurricular position as Software Developer at the Co-Development Lab at the Ryerson Biomedical Zone in collaboration with St. Michael's Hospital Head Injury Clinic. Work was done to design and develop an app targeted to people with head injury to improve patient experience through knowledge, interventions and tracking of Persistent Post Concussion Symptoms. 

My responsibilities also included managing both development tasks while also considering healthcare perspectives, as well as understanding patient needs and requirements to help educate and self manage their symptoms to optimize their recovery. In applying for this position I had to prepare a [presentation][head-app-slides] on my understanding of the patient journey and the approach I would take for the design and development work.

Through the experience designing and developing a health application I more fully understood the role technology plays as a tool shared between patient and provider to enable recovery.

## Challenges & Learnings

### Design and Development misalignment
**Challenge**
What is the most efficient way to develop a high quality MVP that meets user needs?

**Strategies to Overcome Obstacle**
* Meet with the clinical team to review product requirements and map them to the feature components
* Meet with product team to identify where compromises need to be made, and what can be done while still addressing user needs

**Learning**
* Try to formalize product requirements prior to requesting/starting wireframes
* Once product requirements are finalized, start with low-fidelity wireframes (paper) as changes can be easily made in this stage then move to high-fidelity wireframes once approved

---

## Deliverables produced
* Low and high-fidelity wireframes
* UX flow diagrams
* “Dumb” prototypes using Invision

## Next steps
My work on the project was completed as of March 2018 as there was not enough funding and resources available at the time to continue. As of March 2018 the project team was in search of a developer to take the designs and bring them to life as a progressive web app.
