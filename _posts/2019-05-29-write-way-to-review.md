**Lead Author, 3D printing and amputation: a scoping review (Jun. 2018- May. 2019)**

I was lead author on a [scoping review "3D Printing and Amputation"][scoping-review] in the Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology Journal and was able to present this scoping review research poster at Ontario Association for Amputee Care Conference 2019. 

Through this experience I was able to learn more about the research process in a clinical setting.

## My role
**Lead Author**
* Author on the literature review paper on 3D printing technology and its application to the field of amputation research
* Examined how 3D could expedite the prosthetic fitting process for patients with lower limb loss

---

## Work conducted
* Developed the methodology behind the scoping review
* Read & reviewed over 40 scientific articles surrounding the topic of 3D printing and amputation
* Created a summary of literature, extracting the important information


## Skills developed
**Technical**
* Troubleshoot and work with Ultimaker 3D printer 

**Non-technical**
* Critically analyze scientific papers and extract conclusions & learnings

## Challenges & Learnings

**Challenge**
* How do you begin researching, organizing and writing a scoping review paper? Where do you start and what needs to be done? 

**Approach to Overcome Challenge**
* Ask questions! 
* Consult with a researchers and research assistants within the department 

**Lessons Learned**
* Understanding the research process in a clinical setting

---

## Deliverables produced
* Published scoping review paper
* Presentation at Ontario Association for Amputee Care (OAAC) Conference 2019

## Next steps
No active next steps at this point. As time passes we might want to consider reviewing the literature again as 3D printing gets used in more prosthetic projects.
