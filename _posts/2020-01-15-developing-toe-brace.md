**Inventor & Developer (Jan. 2020- present)**

I took on a personal project to develop a toe brace for a family member to improve comfort and ability to balance and walk. In creating the toe brace, I understood that I would need to have knowledge of anatomy and physiology, assistive devices, and joint movements as well as the skills to design a prototype which can be 3D printed. I gained these concepts through courses I took on Rehab Engineering, Biomechanics, and Anatomy and Physiology.

Through this personal project I was able to go through each stage of device development-- from inital requirements gathering and research, to designing and solutioning, to finally testing and gathering feedback. Iâ€™ve learned that I like to engage with people to solve problems, be hands-on with developing a solution, and gain feedback to improve both my prototype and myself.

## My role
**Inventor & Developer**
* Understand the needs of the individual
* Design a flexible solution to suit lifestyle
* Communicate and gather feedback for further iterations

---

## Work conducted
* User research, gathering needs and requirements
* Research and use of different materials to balance function and comfort
* 3D print design and execution
* Assembly of 3D printed parts
* Gather feedback and consider iterating on design


## Skills developed
**Technical**
* Use of TinkerCad to design the device
* 3D print design

**Non-technical**
* Gather requirements
* Coordinate and communicate with individual for device fitting and measurements
* Communicate device considerations
* Gather feedback on initial prototype

## Challenges & Learnings

### Effective requirements gathering and user research
**Challenge 1**
* How do you conduct effective user research and distinguish between user needs and user wants?

**Strategies to Overcome Obstacle**
* Get an understanding of the user's lifestyle
* Look at the "why" behind the request/need for the device
* Explore co-designing the solution with the user

**Learning**
* Requirements gathering and exploring background before prototyping (user needs vs. user wants) is essential
* Co-designing the solution with the user can bring out details that might have been missed in the requirement gathering interview and ensure a successful solution

**Challenge 2**
* How do you optimize 3D printing settings such as speed, external and internal supports etc.?

**Strategies to Overcome Obstacle**
* Research and understand how the various settings on the 3D printer work to build your object
* If the budget allows, try different settings and adjustments for the 3D printed pieces and test these pieces 

**Learning**
* I created a handful of defective prototypes before I was able to develop something that could be thoroughly tested
* I learned that the balance between 3D printer speed, brim, and support makes all the difference, and getting the right balance can be a trial and error process.

## Deliverables produced
* Toe brace with inner cushion layer for comfort
- First prototype was printed in PLA as the 3D-printer used was not compatible with Ninja Flex flexible rubber
material.
- Cushioning and Velcro strap was added to the final design to ensure a proper comfortable fit.

## Next steps
Iterate based on feedback until a comfortable, suitable solution is found.
