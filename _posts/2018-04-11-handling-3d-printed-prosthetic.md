**Project Lead, Tetra Ryerson (Sep. 2016- Apr. 2018)**

During the school year I maintained a high GPA and secured a position on the Deanâ€™s list whilst developing a 3D printed prosthetic arm that can be detected by Leap Motion. This project required problem solving and analytical skills to create a lightweight and inexpensive body powered device that can engage and encourage patients during their physical therapy sessions through the integration of the virtual reality software, Leap Motion. 

Working in collaboration with Dr. Amanda Mayo from Sunnybrook St. John's Rehabilitation Centre my team and I were able to design and build a working 3D-printed prosthetic arm that uses wrist movements to control prosthetic finger movements. Additional small LED lights were attached to the prosthetic to create enough heat to be detected by Leap Motion. 

Through the Tetra Ryerson project, I gained an interest in learning more about the adoption of innovative manufacturing technology in healthcare.

## Challenges & Learnings

**Challenge 1**
* How do you determine the right settings for the 3D printer (such as build plate, external and internal supports etc.)?

**Strategies to Overcome Obstacle**
* Research and understand how the various settings on the 3D printer work to build your object
* If the budget allows, try different settings and adjustments for the 3D printed pieces and test these pieces 

**Learning**
*

**Challenge 2**
* How do you build the device when some of the 3D printed parts were slightly different than expected and did not fit together properly?

**Strategies to Overcome Obstacle**
* Either adjust the design of the object or manually change the measurements of the parts by using a sander, drill etc. 

**Learning**
*

## Next steps
No active next steps at the moment. Might consider refining the initial prototype.
