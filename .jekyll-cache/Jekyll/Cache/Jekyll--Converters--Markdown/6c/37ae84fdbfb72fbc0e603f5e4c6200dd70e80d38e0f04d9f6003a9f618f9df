I"¥	<p><strong>Lead Author, 3D printing and amputation: a scoping review (Jun. 2018- May. 2019)</strong></p>

<p>I wrote and published a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335211809_3D_printing_and_amputation_a_scoping_review">Scoping Review ‚Äú3D Printing and Amputation‚Äù</a> in the Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology Journal and was able to present this scoping review research poster at Ontario Association for Amputee Care Conference 2019.</p>

<p>Through this experience I was able to learn more about the research process in a clinical setting.</p>
