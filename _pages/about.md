Hi, my name is Danielle Ribeiro. I am a biomedical engineering student at Ryerson University. 

I first became interested in engineering to learn more about designing and developing solutions to assist my uncle who has cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic.

>   After completing years of education and extra curricular projects in assistive device research and design I realize my passion is building solutions to create opportunities for individuals with chronic diseases and disabilities.

I first gained an understanding of the intricacies of device development as a Project Lead for Tetra Ryerson. During the school year I maintained a high GPA and secured a spot on the Deanâ€™s list whilst working to develop a 3D printed assistive device that can be detected by Leap Motion. Through the Tetra Ryerson project, I gained an interest in learning more about the adoption of innovative manufacturing technology in healthcare. I worked alongside a team from Sunnybrook St. John's Rehabilitation Centre to examine how 3D printing could expedite the prosthetic fitting process for patients with lower limb loss. Through this experience, I took the initiative to write and publish a Scoping Review "3D Printing and Amputation" in the Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology Journal and I had the opportunity to present this scoping review research poster at Ontario Association for Amputee Care (OAAC) conference 2019. 

Shortly afterwards I pursued an extracurricular position as Software Developer at the Co-Development Lab at the Ryerson Biomedical Zone  in collaboration with St. Michael's Hospital Head Injury Clinic. Through the experience designing and developing a health application I more fully understood the role technology plays as a tool shared between patient and provider to enable recovery. 

My well-rounded exposure to health technology design and development enables me to challenge myself in this industry and support my path to success.

>   My educational background in biomedical engineering and extracurricular experiences in software development, 3D printing, and research have prepared me well to succeed as a Biomedical Engineer.

I hope to learn how to take a human-centered approach to design and develop assistive devices for improved quality of life. I am in the process of pursuing a graduate degree and I look forward to one day achieving a rewarding career designing and developing technical solutions and devices to assist those living with physical disabilities like my uncle.
