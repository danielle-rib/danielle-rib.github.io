Hi, my name is Danielle Ribeiro. I am a Masters of Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Toronto (graduating August 2023). 

***
>   I am a results-driven Biomedical Engineer with extensive experience in designing and prototyping medical devices, conducting research projects, and collaborating with industry partners.

I first became interested in engineering to learn more about designing and developing solutions to assist my uncle who has cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic. 

I gained an understanding of the intricacies of device development as a Project Lead for Tetra Ryerson. During the school year I maintained a high GPA and secured a spot on the Deanâ€™s list whilst working to develop a 3D printed assistive device that can be detected by Leap Motion. Through the Tetra Ryerson project, I was determined to learn more about the adoption of innovative manufacturing technology in healthcare. I worked alongside a team from Sunnybrook St. John's Rehabilitation Centre to examine how 3D printing could expedite the prosthetic fitting process for patients with lower limb loss. Through this experience, I took the initiative to write and publish a Scoping Review "3D Printing and Amputation" in the Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology Journal and I had the opportunity to present this scoping review research poster at Ontario Association for Amputee Care (OAAC) conference 2019. 

In my position as Software Developer at the Co-Development Lab at the Ryerson Biomedical Zone in collaboration with St. Michael's Hospital Head Injury Clinic. Through the experience designing and developing a health application I more fully understood the role technology plays as a tool shared between patient and provider to enable recovery. 

In my post-graduate experiences, I have designed and prototyped jigs/devices to accelerate and regulate testing processes. I have also integrated mechanical and electrical hardware with textiles, analyzed pressure sensing signals, and tested smart textile products.

As I approach the completion of my Master's program in Biomedical Engineering, I have further developed my skills and knowledge in areas such as bio-materials, medical device design, and regulatory policies. I have completed coursework in bio-mechanics, bio-instrumentation, and medical imaging and have gained experience conducting research projects in collaboration with industry partners.

I am determined to take a human-centered approach to design and develop assistive devices for improved quality of life. I look forward to one day achieving a rewarding career designing and developing technical solutions and devices to assist those living with physical disabilities like my uncle.
